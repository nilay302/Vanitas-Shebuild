//
// Convenient: Pads are convenient to use and the most popular products used by urban women. You may keep them in your handbag for use on the go, and you don’t need to put anything in them to wear them overnight. They are safer to use during heavy bleeding because they absorb more and maybe change anywhere there is a washroom.
//
// Better Hygiene: It’s easier to change a pad, but the rapid flow needs frequent absorbent changes. In such situations, a sanitary pad is preferable in a heavy menstrual flow.
//
// Available In Variety: Incontinence pads, like menstruation pads, come in a broad range of sizes, shapes, absorption powers, and other features so, you may get a lot of options to choose what is perfect for you.

//
// Sanitary Pads Cons
// Sanitary pads can indeed work wonders in a woman’s life. However, along with their benefits, certain sanitary pads can have disadvantages.
//
// Cotton isn’t used in all pads. Some pads are made of synthetic materials and contain chemicals that bleached to look clean and white, which may cause wetness, blockage, and be prone to severe health issues.
// Sanitary napkins cannot use more than 4-5 hours, it might cause bad odour, rashes, and itching can make it difficult to walk.
// Although some pads are bulky, some are thinner than ever, which is more likely to be visible under certain clothes.
// Most sanitary napkins are not eco-friendly, and they include artificial perfumes for odour removal, which are neither natural nor good.
// When you wear a pad for a long time, it causes rashes, pain, and a block in airflow to your vaginal area, which increases the risk of bacterial infection and skin illnesses.
// You can’t swim in a pad because may float on while you’re swimming.
// Because the sound of peeling pads off your underwear is so sound they aren’t discreet.
